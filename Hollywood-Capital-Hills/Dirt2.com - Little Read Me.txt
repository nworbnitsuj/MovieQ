Hello, I made this font obviously with the hollywood sign in mind. Nothing more to say other than that. 

I added the bottom grounds to "Hollywood Capital Hills" so they appear to look like the tops of silhouetted hills with the sign text above. The regular version is just the text without the sign holders or scenery and the blank version is the most useless file - I am including it because you can use the hills and change the colors from the main text (using photoshop and whatnot) and use the regular font on top.

If you want to donate you can send me money through paypal to sales@sickcapital.com

Free for personal (non-profit, school, etc) use. 

To use for products and commercial merchandise you can pay for the font at SICKCAPITAL.COM

Thanks & Enjoy.
